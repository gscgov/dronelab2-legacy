            <h2>Lab Environment Setup</h2>

            <p>When you made a request to take this hands-on lab, there were some background tasks that were performed on your behalf in order to prepare the lab environment, which are described below. Don't worry if you have some questions about these concepts... you will get a lot more explanation and hands-on experience as you move through lab steps.</p>

            <img src="./img/prodFlow_explanation.png" width="100%" />

            <p>
                <b>Created Two Lab Environment Flows </b><br>

                As depicted above, a Production Flow was created to support new functionality that illustrates Hybrid Cloud integration between the Remote Drone Console application and the IEL private Cloud. An additional Lab Flow was created to facilitate the hands-on activities with IBM’s most common integration services in a Hybrid Multicloud context, which each user will encounter in Lab Steps 1-3.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Created Drone Controller services in IEL Private Cloud </b><br>
                
                The drone controller application is an integral part of this lab – it interacts with physical and virtual resources at the IEL (Industry Engineering Lab in Coppell, TX) and its private cloud, along with providing API endpoints that can orchestrate the appropriate functionality. This application, along with a drone activity database, was deployed within the IEL private cloud OpenShift Cloud Platform (OCP), which is used for the lab’s Production Flow.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Provisioned a second OCP cluster in the IBM Cloud environment</b><br>

                The initial IBM Cloud organization OCP cluster where the Remote Drone Console application was deployed from Lab 1 acts as the public cloud, while a new OCP cluster that will be in focus during this lab in Steps 1-3 acts as a simulated private cloud. Even though this additional cluster is still in the IBM Cloud environment, it was created to enable each lab taker to have visibility into the application artifacts and configurations that were deployed so that they can perform hands-on activities.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Provisioned Cloud services* </b><br>

                Several IBM Cloud services were prepared and provisioned for lab users within the IBM Cloud organization, including Secure Gateway, API Connect, App Connect, and IBM Cloudant.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Deployed a Secure Gateway Client in both target Environments</b><br>

                To achieve the necessary Secure Gateway service configuration, a Secure Gateway Client was deployed within a project in the second IBM Cloud cluster to facilitate hands-on exploration that will be used in Lab Steps 1-3. In addition, a Secure Gateway Client was also deployed within the IEL private cloud environment to enable the IBM Cloud Remote Drone Console application functionality that will be leveraged as part of the lab’s Production Flow. In each case, preliminary configuration was performed to establish connection between the Secure Gateway Client in each Flow’s environment and the Secure Gateway Service running at the IBM Cloud organization level.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Deployed a project and artifacts for each lab user in the IBM Cloud </b><br>

                A project with a simplified Drone Controller application and a stubbed version of the drone database was deployed for each lab user within the second IBM Cloud OCP cluster. In addition, YAML files were provided to allow each user to walk through the setup of API Connect and App Connect services.
            </p>



            <div class="question">
                💡 * Why didn’t I see Cloud Pak for Integration in these lab steps? <span class="readmore">[Click to Read More]</span>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>
                    IBM Cloud Pak for Integration would be the obvious choice to implement the functionality discussed in this lab in a production environment, where drone resources/data that the operators of the Remote Drone Console need to access resides across Hybrid Multi cloud environments— both public and private. That said, for the purposes of this lab, we chose the on-demand IBM cloud services for the following reasons:<br><br>
                    1. To avoid upfront capital expenses and to have predictable ongoing operating expenses.<br>
                    2. To avoid the additional administrative interfaces in Cloud Pak for Integration that would have been introduced before getting to the integration services that were of specific focus for this lab.<br>
                    3. To more easily manage the pricing plan and user administration for the specific required resources (Secure Gateway, API Connect, App Connect, Cloudant, etc.) that were available through IBM public cloud services in a context that the users were already familiar with.<br><br>
                    In short, using the IBM Public cloud services gave us the ability to provision and administer resources on-demand and only pay for what was needed, while still allowing the lab user to learn about three of Cloud Pak for Integration's powerful capabilities.</p>

                    <p>
                        In this step, the first few instructions may seem familiar – you should be comfortable with navigating to and within an OpenShift web console in the IBM organization cluster based on your completion of the first Drone lab. As a reminder, you can always reference the first lab’s instructions guide here <a href="https://ielgov.github.io/dronelab1" target="_blank">https://ielgov.github.io/dronelab1</a>. In this lab, you will focus on a different cluster: one that emulates a real-life organization that has its own private service.</p>

                    <p>
                        The purpose of this setup was to demonstrate the technology and value behind connecting various applications and services between different clusters, even if they are public or private. In a typical case, an application may want to access services that are located in a private cloud. With the inherit nature of private cloud, it may seem problematic to introduce communication with any public cloud application. </p>

                                    <p>Let’s take a moment to review some concepts you will be delving into in the next few steps. Consider two parties involved: </p>

                                    <p>1. the Operators that use the Remote Drone Operations Console application, and,</p>

                                    <p>2. an organization, “IEL Drones-To-Go”, which has private on-prem resource in Coppell, TX that allows piloting and observing of local drones.</p>

                                <td width="70%" style="text-align: center">

                            </tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>

                    <p>IEL Drones-To-Go wants users like the Operators to access their drone service, wants to easily manage their access, and wants to make sure this connection is done securely so they aren’t compromised in any way.</p>

                    <p>The Operators, owners and users of the Remote Drone Operations Console, want to connect the service that IEL Drones-To-Go provides. </p>

                    <p>You will explore how IBM® Secure Gateway can help enable the connection between the Public Safety Situational Awareness Operator users in one cloud environment and the IEL Drones-To-Go services that are  running in another cloud environment. By deploying the lightweight and natively installed Secure Gateway Client, a secure, persistent connection can be established between your environment and the cloud. You can imagine the Secure Gateway Client is like an on-prem bouncer, checking who wants access based on their list. </p>

                    <p>Secure Gateway allows the safe connection of applications and resources regardless of their location. This is important - rather than bridging your environments at the network level like a traditional VPN, Secure Gateway provides granular resource control operating with the principle of least privilege as its core tenet.</p>

                    <p>In this step of the lab, you learn about how to use Secure Gateway to bridge connection between the Remote Drone Operations Console and the on-prem resource at IEL Drones-To-Go. In later steps, you will continue to get more access to the IEL Drone-To-Go service, including accessing APIs and even invoking related flows. </p>

                    <p>In the introduction of this step, you read an analogy made regarding the Secure Gateway Client, acting as an on-prem bouncer, checking who wants access based on their list. This list is significant – it’s referred to as the Access Control List (ACL). You can allow or restrict (deny) access to on-premises resources by making modifications to the ACL. This can be done interactively using the client commands or specifying a file that contains the ACLs you want to have in affect.</p>
                    
                    <p>ACL enables the Secure Gateway client to access the identified resource (hostname or IP address) in the environment and allows the request from Secure Gateway server. In order to identify the lab drone controller's information, click on the big center icon for the drone-controller node, opening the right side menu.</p>

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>The Access Control List (ACL) is a not a term specific to IBM Secure Gateway. In fact, in networking, an ACL is one of the most fundamental components of security.</p>

                        <p>An Access Control Lists “ACL” is a function that watches incoming and outgoing traffic and compares it with a set of defined statements. Access Control Lists “ACLs” are network traffic filters that can control incoming or outgoing traffic. ACLs work on a set of rules that define how to forward or block a packet at the router’s interface. An ACL is the same as a Stateless Firewall, which only restricts, blocks, or allows the packets that are flowing from source to destination.</p>

                        <p>When you define an ACL on a routing device for a specific interface, all the traffic flowing through will be compared with the ACL statement which will either block it or allow it. The criteria for defining the ACL rules could be the source, the destination, a specific protocol, or more information. ACLs are common in routers or firewalls, but they can also configure them in any device that runs in the network, from hosts, network devices, servers, etc. </p>

For now, let’s take a look at the service resource,  where you can get the drone-controller's route name (hostname) and port#, which has the S icon before it.</p>

Take note of the Service Routing on the right side – you will see the Cluster IP address location, along with Service Port Mapping (8080). To make it easier for lab administration, for the next steps you will use the namespace instead of the Cluster IP address. It should be noted that both will work and enable access accordingly.</p>

                        <p>A Kubernetes namespace provides a mechanism to scope resources in a cluster. In OpenShift, a project is a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations.</p>

                            - Named resources to avoid basic naming collisions.<br>

                        💡 What is the benefit of using an ACL? <span class="readmore">[Click to Read More]</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>The main idea of using an ACL is to provide security to your network. Without it, any traffic is either allowed to enter or exit, making it more vulnerable to unwanted and dangerous traffic. To improve security with an ACL you can, for example, deny specific routing updates or provide traffic flow control.</p>
                        
                        <p>For example, you could have a routing device that has an ACL which is denying access to host A into the one network, and at the same time, it is allowing access to host B in another network, even if there are other hosts in both networks. With an ACL you can filter packets for a single or group of IP addresses or different protocols, such as TCP or UDP. By being picky and controlling access to a very granular level, you can ensure the security of your operations.</p>

                        <p>Within a Secure Gateway, a destination is a definition of how to connect to a specific on-premises or cloud resource. Once the destination has been created, the Secure Gateway servers will provide it with a unique public endpoint where it will listen for connections while the gateway is connected.</p>

                        <p>Let’s get started by navigating away from the Access Control List in Step 1.4. You will want to open a new tab and go to the list of Resources within the 1500867 - IBM account. By expanding the Cloud Foundry Services section, you will find the Secure Gateway instance (DroneLab_Secure Gateway-jv) that already exists. </p>

                        <div class="step">In a new tab, open <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/resources" target="_blank">https://cloud.ibm.com/resources</a>. Then expand the Cloud Foundry Services section. Click on DroneLab_Secure Gateway-jv.</div>

                        <p>You should see the Secure Gateway Dashboard, which displays the total inbound and outbound traffic along with the option to select gateways that were premade. Based on the group number you were assigned in Step 1.4.3; you will want to select the corresponding gateway that matches your group number.</p>

                        <div class="question">

                        <p>For your information, there are two methods for creating your destination: a guided setup that shows how each piece fits into the overall architecture and an advanced setup that provides all fields and options on a single panel. It should be noted that the guided setup does not allow for the configuration of proxy information, server name indicators, reject unauthorized or the upload of a destination-specific cert/key pair.

                            <p><b>IBM Secure Gateway - Destinations Explained:</b></p>

                            <p>Secure Gateway enables the communication between client and destination environment. The <b>destination</b> configuration within Secure Gateway helps to identify the resource in the destination environment and defines the communication protocol between the client resource and the destination resource.
                                <br>
                                Destinations defined within the Secure Gateway can use HTTP/HTTPS, unencrypted TCP, Transport Layer Security (TLS) server-side, and TLS Mutual Auth. TLS Mutual authentication is an obvious choice for any connections that handle sensitive data transfers, as each side can be sure there is no HTTPS proxy (spyware, or hacker) inspecting the traffic between the server and the client.</p>
                            <p> To simplify for the purposes of this hands-on drone lab, a containerized drone controller (destination) was deployed within a Red Hat OpenShift cluster (private cloud) and configured to listen to <b>TCP</b> connections without requiring authentication.</p>

                            <p>To facilitate a secure connection, the Secure Gateway will enable communication with the Remote Drone Operations Console application running in another Red Hat OpenShift cluster (public cloud) using the <b>HTTPS:server-side</b> option. By contrast, if <b>HTTP</b> option had been used, it would not guarantee a secure connection.

                                <br>
                                Furthermore, by using the <b>TLS authentication</b> option between the Secure Gateway and the destination, browser cross-checking measures can be enabled. Since our drone controller was configured without an authentication mechanism, it is appropriate to deselect the option to "Reject unauthorized".</p>

                            <p>For reference, the options below provide a brief explanation of the available protocol options for how your application can initiate connections/requests with Secure Gateway.</p>

                            <p><b>TCP</b><br>
                                No authentication. Your application can communicate directly with the Secure Gateway servers without requiring any certificates.</p>

                            <p><b>HTTP</b><br>
                                TCP connection where the host header is rewritten to match the on-premises hostname.</p>

                            <p><b>No TLS</b><br>
                                No authentication is provided. Your application can communicate directly to the gateway without requiring any certificates.</p>

                            <p><b>TLS: Server Side</b><br>
                                TLS is enabled and the server provides a certificate to prove its authority. You need to accept the server certificate into your application trust-store.</p>

                            <p><b>TLS: Mutual Auth</b><br>
                                The server provides a set of certificates. However, you also need to upload your own certificate or select auto-generate to automatically create a self-signed certificate/key pair that you can download along with the server certificate.</p>

                            <p><b>HTTPS Server-side</b><br>
                                <b>TLS</b>: Server Side connection where the host header is rewritten to match the on-premises hostname.</p>

                            <p><b>HTTPS: Mutual Auth</b><br>
                                <b>TLS</b>: Mutual Auth connection where the host header is rewritten to match the on-premises hostname.</p>

In the response, you will also notice fields named hostname and project_names, with values that reflect the POD and project name where your instance of the drone-controller was deployed in OpenShift Cluster B (visible back in Step 1.4.1). You will see that there are various routes now available - /status, /last_image, /video, /connected. These routes will be used when you connect to one of GSC-Drones-To-Go drones in your Remote Drone Operations Console. </p>

                    <p>
                        In the previous step, you enabled access to a private resource using Secure Gateway. Of course, connecting to a service involves much more than just enabling access. There are many actions you may want to perform in order to interact with the service as well – these actions and events must be understood by the service and your application.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Think about a time you clicked “Checkout and Pay” on an online store or hit “Confirm Appointment” on a clinic’s website. It happens so quickly and seamlessly, and with just a few taps and clicks, disparate services are able to talk to one another so you can quickly get what you need. An API, or Application Programming Interface, is the messenger that takes requests and tells a system what you want to do and then returns the response back to you.

                                        To make it easier, imagine you’re in your car at a drive-through fast food restaurant. When it’s your turn, you tell your order through the microphone or directly to the employee at the window. Your order is made inside, you pay, and your order is handed over to you. In this instance, the fast food restaurant’s kitchen staff are ready to cook - but they need some way of getting the orders to them. The employee at the window provides that link of communication - when you say “#3 with no onions”, the employee at the window understands, and the kitchen staff understand exactly what that means, and make the order. You know this worked by getting your result - a bag with “#3 with no onions” in it.
                                    </p>
                                </td>
                            </tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>

                    <p>
                        Imagine how chaotic and disorderly it would be if everyone in the drive-through had to tell their order to kitchen staff directly. Thankfully, the employee at the window takes orders in a way that everyone can understand - you in your car, and the kitchen staff. The kitchen staff aren’t overwhelmed by taking orders from unfamiliar people, and the people in the drive-through can relax and not have to deal with communicating with the kitchen staff – they all end up talking to the one employee at the window. </p>

                    <p>
                        That employee at the window acts as the API, or the messenger, and the kitchen staff acts as a service you want something from.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now imagine if you owned a kitchen, or multiple kitchens all cooking different things – you would definitely need even more employees at the windows! How would you manage all of them? Is there an easier way to deal with order-taking employees that would work best for you? That’s where a service like API Connect comes in - it allows you to quickly create endpoints that can act as APIs and microservices, which are ready to be leveraged by other applications/services. You can also manage your APIs by setting varying levels of security and visibility, including rate limits. IBM API Connect is an integrated API management offering that allows developers to create, run, manage and secure APIs. The API Connect service also lets you transform and grow your business with insights through detailed analytics with structured filtered searches. In Step 2, you will specifically use API Connect to expose a set of APIs from that service you exposed using Secure Gateway (Step 1).

                        Recall a similar diagram in the beginning of the previous step. As mentioned before, this diagram will grow as you complete each step – notice how this step has added to the different ways your Remote Operations Console communicates with added services.

                    <div class="question">
                        💡 Are there different kinds of catalogs? <span class="readmore">[Click to Read More]</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Yes, the current types of catalogs include: Development, Automatic subscription, and Default. </p>

                        <p>Development - In a development Catalog, staging and publishing actions are forced, meaning that if you republish a previously published Product it is overwritten without warning. If conflicts are found, they are automatically resolved by the system. Unpublish actions happen automatically. By default, a development Catalog is provided for you. A development Catalog must be used only for test purposes. A Developer Portal created from a development Catalog must be used in the same way, that is, for testing purposes only and not for real cases. </p>

                        <p>Automatic subscription - If you enable automatic subscription for a Catalog, testing of your APIs in the API Manager user interface is made easier because a test application is used, with a pre-supplied client ID and client secret, which is automatically subscribed to all the Plans in the Catalog, so you don't have to specify a plan or application when testing. The test application is not subject to rate limits. Automatic subscription is available only for a development Catalog. It’s important to note that Automatic subscription is supported only with the DataPower® Gateway. </p>

                        <p>Default - You can set one of your Catalogs to be the default Catalog. Then, calls to APIs that are published to that Catalog can use a shorter URL that does not include the Catalog name. </p>

                    <p>Within the Drafts page, you may notice other products or API drafts which have not yet been deployed to a catalog. There are two options at the top – Products and APIs. When we import an API definitions file at the next sub-step, you will also be able to add a product at the same time. Click on APIs at the top to get ready for Step 2.2. To make it easier for this lab, we have already created an OpenAPI definition to get a drone's telemetry data that you can import into API Connect and modify.

                        💡 What are some common technical approaches with working with catalogs? <span class="readmore">[Click to Read More]</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Catalogs act as a staging target and a division of the gateway and the Developer Portal. They are useful for separating Products and APIs for testing before you make them available to Developer organizations. </p>

                        <p>The URL for API calls and the Developer Portal are specific to a particular Catalog. In a typical configuration, an API provider organization uses a development Catalog for testing APIs under development and a production Catalog for hosting APIs that are ready for full use. A common approach is to have a development cloud with a development Catalog, a few test Catalogs and a production cloud that might have its own test Catalog. </p>

                        <p>You can use a Space to partition a Catalog so multiple teams can manage Products and APIs independently in a single Catalog. A Space is conceptually like a sub-catalog, except that Products and APIs in all Spaces in a given Catalog are published to the same developer portal. For more information about Spaces, see Using syndication in IBM API Connect. </p>

                                        Within API Connect, you can use an OpenAPI definition file to add a REST API. OpenAPI defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. An OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.

                        YAML (rhymes with "camel” and is a recursive acronym – “YAML Ain't Markup Language ") is a straightforward machine parseable data serialization format designed for human readability and interaction with scripting languages such as Perl and Python. YAML is optimized for data serialization, configuration settings, log files, Internet messaging and filtering. This specification describes the YAML information model and serialization format.

                    <p>If someone already had an existing product,  they could simply import the API definition and choose to add it to a product later. Importing API definitions will allow you to also add a product along with it at the same time. Make sure your information is similar to the below images – under Info, the title of your product should be yourLabName-product. And under Publishing, make sure “Publish this product to a catalog” is checked and then select your newly formed catalog, yourLabName-catalog, from the list. Once these details are added, click “Import”. It’s important to note that APIs become accessible to other application only when a product is published in a catalog.</p>

You are now in the Design view of the APIs – and thanks to the work you did just now, you were able to import the API into a new product, and associate it with your catalog.  In the next sub-step, you will explore this page a bit more and make a few changes as well.</p>

                        In this Design view, you have access to a working draft of the API you imported. There’s a side menu on the left which contains headings for all of the sections related to this API. Indeed, this entire YAML-style page scrolls and is split up by these sections. Feel free to pause these instructions and scroll up and down this Design view. </p>

                    <p>
                        Some sections to pay attention to include the first one at the top –like Info which contains the foundational details related to this API. Scrolling a little further down, the section Scheme designates the HTTPS configuration this API uses.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Looking over the Parameters section will be useful in Step 2.4 when you test the API itself – pay attention to the two user-defined parameters, drone_id and time_stamp, which provide drone identifier and time stamp to fetch the associated drone information.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Path section is where the endpoint path is defined – currently it’s just GET /status. When you imported the API definitions in the previous sub-step, those definitions were already created for you based on your customized YAML file.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Let’s move on by setting the path of the target endpoint of the exposed drone controller application that we enabled with Secure Gateway in Step 1. Scroll to or click the Properties heading on the side menu.
                    </p>

                    <div class="step">After exploring the Design view page, click on the Properties section on the side menu. </div>

                    <p>
                        Once you’re selected the Properties section, find and click on the selected API property – target_host, a user-defined property where connection information will be provided to reach the necessary target resource. Clicking target_host will expand to show catalog-specific values for this property that you’ll need to edit.
                    </p>

                    <div class="step">Click on the target_host property to expand details. </div>

                    <p>
                        Take a closer look at this target_host property. As its description suggests, this property specifies the host for the target URL. Remember at the end of Step 1, you pasted the Cloud Host : Port into these instructions for future usage. Later on, the target_host value for this API is manipulated based on the value it has been provided. Let’s replace this current value with your Cloud Host, conveniently provided below.
                    </p>

                    <div class="step">Click the Copy to clipboard button below and replace the current value in the Default Catalog with Your Secure Gateway Cloud Host URL.</div>

                        Now that you have made that change, click on the Save button (floppy disk icon) in the top right corner. You should see a quick alert in the top right informing you that your API is now saved.

                        Making changes to the API requires republishing the API product. Navigate away from the Design view to the Assemble view – located in the Assemble tab along the top of the page.

We won’t be changing anything here as this lab doesn’t involve further configuration of flows within API Connect.

                        At this point you have successfully created a catalog, imported and edited an API within a new product,  and republished it to your catalog.  The API is now ready to be tested. Recall in the introduction of this step – APIs act as messengers between applications and services. In the previous sub-step, you saw the GET /status endpoint – it required two values (drone_id and time_stamp). When you make a request to get information about a specific drone at a specific time, you will get back a response that includes information in a format that is understood.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let’s begin trying out the API by clicking the Explore button in the top right corner. This will open a list where you can select your own catalog, yourLabName-catalog.
                    </p>

                    <div class="step">Click the Explore button in the top right corner, then click on <span class="labnameHere">YourLabName</span>-catalog from the Catalogs.</div>

                    <p>
                        The Explore tool is used to test API endpoints. It shows the operations for all of the APIs that are contained in a specified catalog. The left pane of the Explore window can be used to select an operation to test. The center pane displays summary information about the endpoint, including its parameters, model instance data, and response codes, and the right pane provides template code to call the endpoint. Let’s focus on the right pane for now. Notice the URL at the top preceded by GET, and the curl request. Click on “Try it” to start testing yourself.

                            The right pane changes to a view where you see the Type headers which are used to indicate the media type of the resource. In this case, you want to read a JSON response. The parameters are listed below and should be familiar – for this current example, change the value of drone_id to drone1 and the value of time_stamp to 0. Then click Call Operation.

                            Once you click Call Operation, you should see a Response added to the bottom of the right pane. The actual request information is listed above. The response includes a response code, headers, and a JSON response that contains data regarding the endpoint you requested – get status of drone #1 (drone_id), at the very beginning (time_stamp). It is served to you in a way that you can understand – and more importantly – your remote drone operations console can understand as well!

                                        Imagine you’re in charge of running a small event online at your workplace. Whenever someone registers for the event, you want them to receive a (1) confirmation email, (2) Slack message telling them where they can connect with others about the event, and (3) store their registration information in an Excel sheet.
                                    </p>

                                        This could be all done manually – but obviously, you’re a busy person, and you may only get time sparingly to do this, and it is still prone to human error. It may get overwhelming if a lot of people sign up at the same time. You may also think – aren’t there services that can do this automatically for me?
                                    </p>

                        In Step 2, you imported API definitions that were able to be tested within API Connect. You were able to view that response data that the API produced – data that could be part of a bigger flow of events. For the event example above, you could use the registration data and have a template for an email ready to go. The registration data could also be used to automatically send a pre-defined Slack message to the signed-up person, and automatically add a row of information to an Excel sheet.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        IBM® App Connect connects all these applications very quickly, regardless of whether they are on the cloud or a private network. And significantly, there is no coding required. Using the App Connect Designer on IBM Cloud makes it easy to connect apps, even applications like Salesforce, Marketo, and SAP, so that when an event occurs in one application, or a request is made to an API, the other connected apps are updated automatically.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Below are some common templates used on App Connect. These contain prebuilt flows which can be created for an API, so that when the request is submitted (such as through a mobile or web application), the flow performs all its actions, and then returns a response that either confirms that the actions were successful, or returns the data that was requested.
                    </p>

                        The lab diagram that has been referenced before is finally complete – take a look below and notice how each step was able to add onto the connections that your Remote Operations Console application had access to. With each service, your application became more powerful due to it being linked to useful resources. As it suggests, you will use the response data you previewed in Step 2, which included the location of the drone, to retrieve data from a database of sensors, thereby creating a very helpful list of sensors near the drone.

                        Before you access the App Connect service, let’s take a look at the database of sensors. In real-life situations, a Public Safety Situational Awareness Operator may want to quickly look at the nearby sensors to gauge the condition of the location they are viewing through the drone. It’s convenient that the GET /status API provided in Step 2 contains the latitude and longitude of the done location that can be used with the sensor location coordinates as well.

                    <p>
                        The sensors’ information is stored in a Cloudant database. IBM Cloudant® is a fully managed, distributed database and is provided as an offering on IBM Cloud. It has already added to your IBM Cloud account. Once you click on the service, launch the dashboard to view the databases. You will take a look at the databased named sensordb.

                        One of the many features Cloudant provides is IBM Cloud Geospatial, or "IBM Cloudant Geo”. Cloudant Geo combines the advanced geospatial queries of a Geographic Information System (GIS) with the flexibility and adaptability of IBM Cloudant's database-as-a-service (DBaaS) capabilities. These capabilities include GeoJSON, IBM Cloudant Geo index, and more.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With IBM Cloudant Geo, all of the following are possible:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        (1) Enable web and mobile developers to enhance their applications by using geospatial operations that go beyond simple bounding boxes<br>
                        (2) Integrate with existing GIS applications, so that they can scale to accommodate different data sizes, concurrent users, and multiple locations.<br>
                        (3) Provide a NoSQL capability for GIS applications, so that large streams of data can be acquired from devices, sensors, and satellites. This data can then be stored, processed, and syndicated across other web applications.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Let’s take advantage of this feature. Sensors have locations that be filtered on – within Cloudant, you’re able to draw polygons on a map and define spatially which sensors to display in a given bounded area. Go ahead and draw a circle on the map to filter sensors.
                    </p>


                    <div class="step">Use the Circle (dot icon) Tool on the right menu bar to draw a circle around a map area of your choosing.</div>

                        The circle you drew has filtered the sensors to only return the ones that are located within the boundary. When you click the JSON view, the list of JSON data pertains to the sensor markers shown on the Map view.  While the details returned  at this point is limited to the identifier and coordinates for each individual sensor, this information could then be used to query the type and values for each sensor which is useful in later lab sub-steps.

Remember these two functions – <b>retrieveSensordata</b> and <span class="blue">getNearBySensors</span>. You will focus on <span class="blue">getNearBySensors</span> for the purposes of activities in the next several steps, but you will also be exposed to <b>retrieveSensordata</b> and asked to consider it within the context of the lab’s Production Flow used by the Remote Drone Console application.

                        The <span class="blue">getNearBySensors</span> API is a simple API flow to demonstrate the capability and simplicity of the App Connect cloud service. For the lab, we developed this flow to show how a web application could get access to Cloudant sensor data that is in close proximity to a given drone’s location by providing the lat/long as input.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The <b>retrieveSensordata</b> may be more typical of a production API flow in that it combines several steps and includes some additional logic. Specifically, this flow is different from the simplified <span class="blue">getNearBySensors</span> API flow as it retrieves the drone’s status and telemetry data using the drone controller’s GET/status API (from API Connect), parses the response to find the drone's location (latitude/longitude) information, and then uses those locations details as input to retrieve sensor readings from the Cloudant database that are in the relevant area. This flow is used by the Remote Drone Console application as part of the lab’s Production Flow.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        App Connect provides a model-driven, code-free approach that lets you easily implement your API operations as integration flows. For less experienced users, App Connect guides you through making models and integration flows you can use to build robust APIs. For experienced developers, App Connect's powerful tooling lets you extend the flow through code. In either model, the tool then builds well-formed OpenAPI definitions automatically.

                    <p>
                        You can preview the flow within App Connect for <span class="blue">getNearBySensors</span> by clicking on the Operations tab on the section and then Edit flow (this may appear as "View Flow". The flow you see is linear – Request > HTTP Invoke method > JSON Parse > Response. As you continue to finish this lab, consider how this flow could be used within the Remote Console Operations application.

                        <p>As mentioned above, the retrieveSensordata API flow is used in the lab’s Production Flow to expose an endpoint for the Remote Drone Console application to dynamically find the location on the drone and then access relevant sensor data that is nearby.</p>

                        <p>
                            The flow uses the following connectors and tools:<br>

                            HTTP endpoint: To invoke the Cloudant’s geospatial REST API call<br>
                            JSON Parsers: To parse the resultant HTTP response and map it to a defined object
                        </p>

                        <p>OPTIONAL: If you want to see the full flow, you can use “Edit flow” after clicking Operations within the retrieveSensordata section. (The button may also appear as “View Flow”). </p>

For this lab, you will turn off “Require application via API key”. This lab does not include viewing the usage of the APIs so this authentication isn’t required. It should be noted that for production level implementations, it may be appropriate to require authentication so that applications that use this API would need to authenticate using an API key and secret or API key alone.   This section would thus manage its key sharing and provide visibility into the API usage after the API is online.

In the next step, you will visit and review the Remote Operations Console application's updated user interface and consider how these service connections enabled the Multi-Hybrid Cloud application with powerful functionality.

                    <p>
                        In the Steps 1, 2, and 3, you learned about the three main services that were integrated with your Remote Operations Console application. These three services are Secure Gateway, API Connect, and App Connect. Let’s review each briefly:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Secure Gateway</b>
                        A cloud service that enables you to establish a secure tunnel between the specific resources you want to connect. Used to enable access to IEL Drones-To-Go, a private cloud service.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>API Connect</b>
                        A modern, intuitive and scalable API platform that lets you create, securely expose, manage and monetize APIs across clouds. Used to create and add APIs that can request and respond with data that belongs of the IEL Drones-To-Go drones.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>App Connect</b>
                        An all-in-one tool for easily connecting apps, integrating data, building APIs and acting on events. Used to invoke flows that can retrieve nearby sensors based on location data of a drone.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        Over the course of this lab, you viewed a diagram that showed how the Remote Operations Console application connected with these services. It is complete – review it once more before moving on.
                    </p>

                    <img class="standardImage" src="./img/flow_3.png">

                    <p>
                        Your Remote Operations Console application is connected to the private cloud that hosts the fictional company GSC-Drones-To-Go service, which is hosted in the IBM Industry Engineering Lab in Coppell, TX.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You may remember that in Drone Lab 1, you saw a list of drones but didn’t go much further than that. In this lab, you will finally get to view what the drone sees, view telemetry data it provides, and see its relevant geospatial information.
                    </p>

                    <div class="important">
                        It is recommended that you revisit the Drone Lab #1 instructions site now
                        if it has been a while since you’ve completed it.
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        If you want to recall specific information regarding the Remote Operations Console, it is recommended you read the instructions for Drone Lab 1, located here: <a href="https://ielgov.github.io/dronelab1" target="_blank">https://ielgov.github.io/dronelab1</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There are two steps worth reviewing prior to finishing this lab.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Step 2 of the first lab contains information regarding accessing RedHat OpenShift through IBM Cloud. While this lab has primarily used Cluster B, you will be revisiting the Cluster A you used in Drone Lab 1. If it’s been a while since you have completed the first lab, it is recommended that you look over this step, including the components related to the OpenShift web console, which will not be covered in detail in this second lab.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Step 5, you may recall, of the first lab contains a breakdown of specific parts of the console application UI. This step contains clickable sections of the page that go into detail regarding the function of each widget. This second lab will not cover this content again and will go directly to a new section of the console application UI - so if it’s been a while, it is recommended that you go over this step again.

                        Now that you’ve explored the services that were used in the Remote Operations Console application, let’s revisit the application and how they were used. As mentioned in the introduction, reviewing certain instructions in Drone Lab 1 may be helpful.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Navigate back to Cluster A, or mycluster-dal12-b3c.4x16, which is a part of the Resources in IBM Cloud. This should be familiar from Drone Lab 1 – launching the OpenShift web console will allow you to choose the Developer perspective, enter the Topology view, and select your project. It is critical you follow those steps correctly – not doing any of them will result in errors.
                    </p>

                    <img class="standardImage" src="./img/4_1_1_A.png" />

                    <div class="step">
                        Open <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/resources" target="_blank">https://cloud.ibm.com/resources</a> (in a new tab).<br>Next, click mycluster-dal12-b3c.4x16 (Cluster A) under the Clusters section.<br><br>
                        Then click on OpenShift web console.

                    <div class="important">
                        These 3 steps must be completely accurately in order to not encounter issues later!
                    </div>

                    <div class="step">
                        (1) Make sure you are in the Developer perspective (and not in the Administrator perspective) by clicking the top left dropdown under the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform logo. <i>(You may see an error appear on screen - complete all 3 steps first).</i><br><br>
                        (2) Click the Project dropdown and select <span class="labnameHere">YourLabName</span>-2020-lab-1.<br><br>(3) Make sure you are in the Topology view by clicking Topology in the left side menu.<br><br>

                        Once you have completed the 3 steps above, your Topology view may be similar to what you see below. It is okay if your Topology is different – you will review the nodes in this view in the next sub-step.

                        Notice the environment (env) variables in the Environment tab for this HTTP forward node. Just as you explored Secure Gateway (SG), API Connect (API), and App Connect (APP), there are values that have already been provided that are similar in syntax to the URLs you had produced in each previous step. Since the Remote Operations Console application has already been connected to the IEL Drones-To-Go service, these values were already taken care of for you.

                        This website should be familiar from Drone Lab 1 - if you would like to review each section of the Remote Operations Console, please revisit Step 5 of the Drone Lab 1 instructions site <a href="https://ielgov.github.io/dronelab1" target="_blank">https://ielgov.github.io/dronelab1</a>.

                        When you’re ready, go to the Available Drones section. Notice that the list of drones each have a status. The drones with the Available status can be connected to. These are the drones provided by the IEL Drones-To-Go service, and thanks to the services you explored earlier, this application is able to get access to these drones. Click on Connect on either of the drones to open its drone viewer modal.

If you recall in in Step 1, you enabled access to these drones in the IEL Drones-To-Go private cloud service with Secure Gateway and in Step 2, you were able to get the drone’s location coordinates through an API you had set up, and all of the sensors could be filtered to show nearby ones using the flow you added in Step 3. The connections to these services can be observed as you look at this section.

                    Let’s review what we accomplished in this lab overall:
                </p>

                <p>
                    First, you set up a Secure Gateway connection in order to enable access to drones that belong to the private cloud GSC-Drones-To-Go service.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next, you added API definition with API Connect so that you can get information from the drones, including getting back its current location.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then, you created a flow using App Connect to use that drone location information to get back a list of sensors that are close to the drone’s location.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lastly, you explored the Remote Operations Console application’s drone viewer modal, and got to see the different components associated with a drone that were enabled through the use of the above services.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The takeaway of this lab is a better understanding of how various IBM services can be easily connected to a cloud application in order to augment its security, functionality, and connectivity.
                </p>
